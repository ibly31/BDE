Description:

The long wait is finally over! The Block Dude Evolved 2.0 update is here. I took all of your feedback to heart and rewrote the game from scratch, and included 11 new levels, a built-in level editor and 3 visual control schemes.


Do you remember that fun calculator game you used to play back in high school math class? Well, now all of that fun has been fully realized on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. Block Dude Evolved is a recreation of a puzzle game created for the TI-83 and TI-84 series of calculators. Now, you can play that challenging game any way and anywhere you want.

Block Dude Evolved has:
• 22 Levels: 11 classic and 11 new ones.
• A built-in level editor so you can create your own levels or edit existing ones.
• 3 visual control schemes so you can feel the feedback from the screen. Includes a look-alike of the TI-84 directional pad.
• Game center support complete with achievements.
